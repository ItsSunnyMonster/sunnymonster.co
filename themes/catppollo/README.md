# Catppollo Theme

A custom theme based on the [apollo](https://github.com/not-matthias/apollo/)
theme but with [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) colours
and also some of my own features.

## Changes

- catppuccinified obviously
- added a cool animation to the links
- used lexend font for body for easier reading
- footer
- logos
- fancy theme switcher with animation
- mobile support (that's important)
- fediverse social icon

## License

I'm keeping the MIT license for the theme files only.
(Theme files refer to everything inside of the catppollo directory.)
