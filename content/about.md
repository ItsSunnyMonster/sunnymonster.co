Hi! I'm SunnyMonster (and no, my first name is not Sunny, but you could call me that if you wish) and this is my personal website <span style="font-size: 0.7em">(wHo WoUlD'vE kNoWn!!11!11!)</span>. Here you will find my [blogs](/posts) where I will occasionally share things that I happen to be doing at any given time. You will also find links to my [projects](/projects).

# Who am I exactly?

I am a programmer and composer who easily gets interested in a variety of things from linguistics to psychology.
Not sure what else to say here...

# Etymology of my Name(s)

You might also be wondering why my usernames are the way they are. I have had a few names since my time and here is an explanation of all of them.

## Cats-cats-123

This username was used by me to create my first ever Scratch account. Back then I had no idea how to make any sort of username, so I took inspiration
from one of my parents' email accounts, which I am not going to share here.

## SunnyHold

This came up around when I started wanting to make a YouTube channel. Obviously Cats-cats-123 was not going to cut it as a channel name.
So I brainstormed for ideas. At this point, I'm still not that fluent with English. So, I thought:
There is a bus stop in Auckland called "Sunnynook"... and I like sunny days... and I would love to simply "hold" the sun in place so that it doesn't go away.
And there it was: SunnyHold

## SunnyMonster

I quickly realised how stupid of a name SunnyHold is. So I brainstormed for more ideas, and eventually I took inspiration from the username of a Hermitcraft member,
StressMonster. So I switched out "Hold" for "Monster", and there you go, SunnyMonster.

(I guess you could say SunnyMonster is a portmanteau of Sunnynook and StressMonster.)

## Piscerii

This is a fun one. After having the name SunnyMonster for a while, I started to think that it is very childish. I needed a "cooler" name.
So I decided to take inspiration from my zodiac sign this time. Funnily enough, I knew what my zodiac sign is in my native language, but I thought
it translated to Aquarius in English. So I came up with a bunch of ideas for that, such as Aquarii, Aquari and stuff like that, before realising that I am
actually a Pisces. So then I arrived on Piscerii.

## Pyceri

Piscerii seemed quite long and weird looking, so I decided that I needed something cleaner. So I simplified it to Pyceri. Of course, these names didn't stick
because I realised that so many people know me by SunnyMonster at this point that it would be very weird for me to change. So I kept SunnyMonster as my name.

## jan Sanimonsi

By this point, I have learnt [toki pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) and long story short I needed to adapt my name to its phonology. I think
Sanimonsa or Sanimonta would be closer to SunnyMonster, but I arrived on Sanimonsi because it sounded right to me.
In toki pona, every proper noun is an adjective, so I cannot simply call myself "Sanimonsi", I needed to add the word "jan" in front, which means person.
So now "jan Sanimonsi" would mean something like "The SunnyMonster person" or "The person named SunnyMonster".

So here is the etymology:

**jan**: from Cantonese äºº (person) <br>
**Sanimonsi**: phonetically translated from SunnyMonster, a portmanteau of Sunnynook and StressMonster.
