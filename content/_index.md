Hi, I'm **SunnyMonster**, a programmer, composer and (almost) everything-enthusiast from New Zealand. Welcome to my site!

## Currently Working On

- **This Website**: I am a bit rusty with web-dev, so it is taking a while to iron out all the bugs.
  I will upload the code of this website to GitHub very soon after I clean up my horrifically formatted
  code. In the meantime, check back here every so often since this list can change and also I will be posting
  about random stuff sometimes.

- **SMve / Order of the Stone**: My project codenamed "Minecraft: Reimagined", which is an attempt at making
  a Minecraft-like game completely from scratch, hopefully avoiding the fundamental pitfalls the actual Minecraft
  experienced.

- **A (slightly unconventional) video essay about English spelling**: A school assignment which I will upload
  to YouTube once it's done, where I talk about a slightly unconventional and very impractical spelling
  reform idea I thought of.

> also yes of course the colour scheme is catppuccin. it's the best colour scheme, ~you can't~ change my mind.
