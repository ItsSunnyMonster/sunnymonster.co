Hi, I'm SunnyMonster, and welcome to my site!

Check out my about me [here](/about) if you have no idea who I am :)

I really have no idea what else to fill this page... I guess you will get some code snippets:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello World!");

  panic!("Oh no I don't know what else to write in here either.");
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  printf("I guess here's some C as well");

  return 0;
}
```
