Hi, I'm **SunnyMonster** (he/they <span style="white-space: nowrap">ğŸ©·ğŸ’œğŸ’™</span>), a 16 year-old programmer, composer and (almost) everything-enthusiast from New Zealand. Welcome to my site!

(not sure why that felt so cringe to write)

## Currently Working On

- **SMve / Order of the Stone**: My project codenamed "Minecraft: Reimagined", which is an attempt at making
  a Minecraft-like game completely from scratch, hopefully avoiding the fundamental pitfalls the actual Minecraft
  experienced.

- **A (slightly unconventional) video essay about English spelling**: A school assignment which I will upload
  to YouTube once it's done, where I talk about a slightly unconventional and very impractical spelling
  reform idea I thought of.
